# INTRODUCTION

This project is part of an academic assessment for the "Information and Technology Skills" course in the Master's program "Language, Society, and Communication" at the University of Bologna.

It focuses on analyzing and using knowledge graphs from ARCO and Large Language Models. The selected ARCO ontology was about clothing description. The main goal of using this ontology is to explore clothing characteristics and compare LLMS with the better option to enrich the knowledge graph.

In the following parts you will have information about the methodology, results and analysis, discussion, conclusion and possible future developments.

# DISCUSSION

| Problem        | Solution        | 
|:-------------|:------------------|
| There is a lot of information on the ARCO ontology| We had to limit a few results because the query took so much time to charge results| 
| Some information from the ARCO clothing ontology did not appear, as it is the case of bottom items. | We decided to use the general clothing information. | 
| There were some results which belonged to different ontologies.    | We searched for more specific vocabulary to use and checked the prefixes.     |
