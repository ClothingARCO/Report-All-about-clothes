# INTRODUCTION

Welcome to our website, we are Laura, Alena, Aurora and Juliana. This project is part of an academic assessment for the "Information and Technology Skills" course in the Master's program "Language, Society, and Communication" at the University of Bologna.

It focuses on analyzing and using knowledge graphs from ARCO and Large Language Models. The selected ARCO ontology was about clothing description. The main goal of using this ontology is to explore clothing characteristics and compare LLMS with the better option to enrich the knowledge graph.

In the following parts you will have information about the methodology, results and analysis, discussion, conclusion and possible future developments.


# [METHODOLOGY](./another-page.html).

> The tools used for developing this project were: 
>
*  GITHUB
*  SPARQL 
*  ARCO
*  CHAT GPT
*  GEMINI
*  LLAMA
*  Class material

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

# DISCUSSION

| Problem        | Solution         | 
|:-------------|:------------------|
| There is a lot of information 
on the ARCO ontology| We had to limit a few results because the 
query took so much time to charge results| 
| out of stock | good and plenty   | 
| ok           | good `oreos`      | 
| ok           | good `zoute` drop | 

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

```
The final element.
